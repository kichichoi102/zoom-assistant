# zoom-assistant
A bot that lets you sleep in by automatically joining and leaving zoom meetings for you.

## Requirements:

PyAutoGui is best optimized for python version == 3.7, so this version was used. \n
Unfortunately, my venv folder was too large so I'll leave steps on how to make and install required packages yourself.

1. open cmd
2. Change to the directory of zoom-assistant folder
3. use: 
```
py -3.7 -m venv (desired_name_of_venv_folder)
```
4. install the required packages on requirements.txt:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Select the interpreter in the venv folder in your IDE
- eg. "C:\Users\Daniel\Desktop\zoom-assistant\zoom_env\Scripts"
